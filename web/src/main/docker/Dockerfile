VOLUME /tmp # reate a temporary file on my host under "/var/lib/docker" and link it to the container under "/tmp".
COPY build/libs/web-0.1.0.war /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/webapp.war
RUN sh -c "touch /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/webapp.war" #  "touch" the jar file so that it has a file modification time (Docker creates all container files in an "unmodified" state by default). This actually isnâ€™t important for the simple app that we wrote, but any static content (e.g. "index.html") would require the file to have a modification time.
